 - Explain how strategies come in the form pick_*_from_*
   - specific will always pick the same one, eg if you call this function repeatedly they'll work on the same one.
     - the heuristic used internally is "lowest number", so if multiple specific methods are used, they are more likely to 
       overlap.
   - random will pick a random from a described subset
   - specific methods fall back to pick_specific_from_all and random methods fall back to pick_random_from_all
     - eg if you pick from happy users, and there are no unhappy users.
 - originally this was a model of Wine (users/apps/bugs), but it can just as easily apply to anything:
   - "apps" are "features", "bugs" are "work items"
 - docstrings for all strategies

Features:
 - take arguments from command line instead of defining up top
 - Consider a parameter for zipf's other than 0.5 == sqrt
 - Implement pareto-distribution probability (80/20 rule) for apps/bugs
